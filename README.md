Redmine base_jquery plugin
==========================

I'm tired of rewriting hacks to include jQuery in my plugins on and on, so if you have a running redmine 2.0.x you can use this plugin and depend on it in your own plugins before jQuery replaces Prototype into Redmine's core (which is planned for Redmine 2.1.0, see http://www.redmine.org/issues/11445).
